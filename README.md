## Objective

In this exercise, you will:

1. Identify and fix multiple issues in a React app using Cursor's debugging tools.
2. Strengthen your understanding of React component structure, props, state, and event handling.
3. Explore debugging workflows using snapshots and error navigation.

## Description

This is a simple React shopping cart application where users can add products to their cart, view the cart, and see the total price.

## Tech Stack

- React
- CSS

## Features

- Add products to the cart
- View cart items
- See total price of items in the cart
- Add new products

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-shopping-cart.git
   cd react-shopping-cart
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Usage

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application running.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Study the Code

1. Take some time to thoroughly review the provided code.
2. Try to understand the overall structure and functionality of the app.
3. Make notes of any parts that seem unclear or potentially problematic.

### Step 2: Run the App and Observe

1. Run the application and interact with it.
2. Pay attention to any unexpected behaviors or visual inconsistencies.
3. Open your browser's developer tools and check the console for any error messages.

### Step 3: Use Cursor's Debugging Tools

1. Use Command-L to navigate through errors and warnings in the console.
2. Create snapshots of the current state of your code before making any changes.
3. Utilize Cursor's error navigation features to pinpoint the locations of issues in the code.
4. Use the "Explain" feature to understand the error message and suggest a fix.
5. Test your changes thoroughly to ensure that no new issues have been introduced.

### Step 4: Identify and Fix the Bugs

1. Based on the error messages and your observations, start identifying the bugs in the code.
2. Use your React knowledge to hypothesize what might be causing each issue.
3. Make changes to fix each bug, creating a new snapshot before and after each fix.
4. Test the app after each fix to ensure the issue is resolved and no new problems have been introduced.

### Step 5: Review and Reflect

1. After fixing all the bugs you've identified, thoroughly test the application to ensure it's working as expected.
2. Review your snapshots to see the progression of your debugging process.
3. Reflect on the bugs you encountered and the solutions you implemented.

## Time Management

- 20-25 minutes: Study the code and run the app to observe issues.
- 30-35 minutes: Use Cursor's tools to identify and fix the bugs.
- 10-15 minutes: Review your changes, test the app, and reflect on the process.

## Key Learning Outcomes

By completing this exercise, you will gain:

1. Experience with real-world debugging scenarios in React applications.
2. Proficiency in using Cursor's debugging tools for efficient problem-solving.
3. A deeper understanding of common React pitfalls and how to avoid them.
4. Improved skills in reading error messages and translating them into actionable fixes.

Remember, the goal is not just to make the app work, but to understand why each bug occurred and how your fixes address the underlying issues. Good luck, and happy debugging!
